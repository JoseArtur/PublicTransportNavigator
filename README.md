# **Goal**

The objective was to implement an application that returns the best bus route to take to reach a destination in the city of Porto, starting from a specific point in the city. The graph structure was used, in addition to thinking about improving the temporal and spatial complexity.

# **Algorithms Implemented**

DFS
BFS
Prim
Dijkstra
MST
# **Project Overview**

A little sample of how to find the shortest distance bus route from FEUP to Trindade.
